# Hippocampi

Hippocampi was a healthcare startup focused on providing chemobrain patients a streamlined telehealth platform. Built primarily in Typescript with the React, Node.js, Drizzle, and Supabase stack, this website was the centerpiece of the SaaS we pitched and provided to doctors, patients, and medical advisors. Attached below is a demo of the functionalities we implemented before taking the website down after the start-up ran out of funding.

# Development Process
This website was built over the course of 5 months in a partnership with Travis Dao. It was pitched to YC and presented to investors, raising a total of $18,000 dollars. There are certain security measures implemented in accordance with HIPAA and Vanta, and can serve as a good starter template for anyone looking to create a telehealth platform. Also stored here are legal documents which were legally drafted and professionally vetted.
