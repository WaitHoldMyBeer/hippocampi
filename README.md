# Hippocampi

Hippocampi was a healthcare startup focused on providing chemobrain patients a streamlined telehealth platform. Built primarily in Typescript with the React, Node.js, Drizzle, and Supabase stack, this website was the centerpiece of the SaaS we pitched and provided to doctors, patients, and medical advisors. Attached below is a demo of the functionalities we implemented before taking the website down after the start-up ran out of funding.
