          This breaks our heartsâ€”seeing a survivor finally beat cancer, only to have their dreams of a normal life
          stolen by its lasting impairments. It's why this story and others inspire our mission at HippoCampi to tackle
          the devastating realities of cognitive and mental decline in cancer patients and survivors.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          To address these challenges, we are building a digital platform that connects patients with comprehensive care
          teams who design personalized treatment plans in just 1-2 weeks, ensuring patients get the care they
          desperately need, when they need it the most.
