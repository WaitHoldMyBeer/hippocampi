            This breaks our heartsâ€”seeing a survivor finally beat cancer, only
            to have their dreams of a normal life stolen by its lasting
            impairments. It's why this story and others inspire our mission at
            HippoCampi to tackle the devastating realities of cognitive and
            mental decline in cancer patients and survivors.

            To address these challenges, we are building a digital platform that
            connects patients with comprehensive care teams who design
            personalized treatment plans in just 1-2 weeks, ensuring patients
            get the care they desperately need, when they need it the most.
